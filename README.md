# HungryHub Frontend Developer Challenge: Tamboon VueJS

## Scenario
Once upon a time.. nope!
So here, you have been temporarily hired by HungryHub and assigned to work on the charity donation project, which the previously assigned front-end developer and designer got the urgent matters to solve, so they will not be able to finish the project on time..

Fortunately, the API server is already done. You will need to grab on the requirements and complete the project while ensuring the application has great engineering and well-designed UI!

**Here are the tasks you must complete:**

## Getting Started

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your frontend application
2. Clone this repository to use as your backend API server
3. Run the backend server:
```
npm run server
```

This will start a JSON Server on port 3001 with the following endpoints:
- http://localhost:3001/charities
- http://localhost:3001/payments

## Rules
Desire to win the war? Well, to make it a little more fun, please remember that

**You cannot:**
- Change the API server.
- Change from JS to other languages.

**In the other hand, feel free to:**
- Edit `README.md` to add documentation. What have you done or how to run or test your app?

**Note**: You can see design inside folder `resources`.

## Surprise us!

Please remember that your patch must consist of multiple separate commits. Your commit message must communicate clearly what has been done in each commit.

If you notice more bugs in the original implementation, you can also add fixes for those. You won't be penalized if you don't. However, we would like to ask you not to add more features than those listed in the mission list.

Let's rock! :metal:
